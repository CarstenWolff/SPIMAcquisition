The [OpenSPIM](http://openspim.org/) project is a collaboration between multiple
labs to establish an accessible, easily adjustable light sheet microscope
system.

The *SPIMAcquisition* plugin for [Micro Manager](https://micro-manager.org) is
the primary means to acquire image stacks with the OpenSPIM setups.

# How to build

To build this plugin, two extra steps are required before letting Maven (or
any Integrated Development Environment with a Maven integration) build the
project: The Micro-Manager artifacts need to be installed locally because they
are not available via any public Maven repository yet.

Assuming that you already have a nightly build (e.g. by following the
[Micro-Manager-dev update site](http://sites.imagej.net/Micro-Manager-dev/)),
install the artifacts into your local Maven repository by executing the
following two commands inside the `ImageJ.app/` directory containing
Micro-Manager:

```bash
cd plugins/Micro-Manager
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=org.micromanager -Dversion=1.4.19-SNAPSHOT \
	-Dpackaging=jar -DartifactId=MMJ_ -Dfile=MMJ_.jar
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=org.micromanager -Dversion=1.4.19-SNAPSHOT \
	-Dpackaging=jar -DartifactId=MMCoreJ -Dfile=MMCoreJ.jar
```

After that, a simple `mvn` will build the `SPIMAcquisition` plugin which can
then be installed by copying `target/SPIMAcquisition-<version>.jar` into
`ImageJ.app/mmplugins/`.
