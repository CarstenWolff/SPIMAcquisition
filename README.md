The [OpenSPIM](http://openspim.org/) project is a collaboration between multiple
labs to establish an accessible, easily adjustable light sheet microscope
system.

The *SPIMAcquisition* plugin for [Micro Manager](https://micro-manager.org) is
the primary means to acquire image stacks with the OpenSPIM setups.
